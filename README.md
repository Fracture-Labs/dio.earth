## Mission

The UNHCR [estimates] that 84 million people are forcibly displaced globally to escape war, persecution or violence.
In many cases, it is unsafe to travel with any identification document,
to ensure their protection when they finally arrive in a destination State,
they are often [registered] by States or NGOs.

We want to provide an option for the forcibly displaced to recover their identity or any data that they may want to have from their home country without having to carry it on their journey.

Since the design of the solution, we have found that use cases for this solution are much more than expected. i.e. _TODO_
