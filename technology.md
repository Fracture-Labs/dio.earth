# Technologies

## Objectives

1. Allow users to store encrypted data, not yet knowing who the recipient will be
2. Ensure that no sole intermediary has the ability to decrypt the data, nor will they obtain the un-encrypted data
3. Provide all of the above services in a decentralized network that performs un-trusted operations

Our technologies showcase proof-of-concepts for both sides of the
encryption / decryption flows.

- [Fracture] - implements the Umbral proxy re-encryption scheme
- [Constitute] - provides a user-friendly approach that abstracts away msot
- Algorand Multi-sig and DAO smart contracts
